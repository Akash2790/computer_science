## Difference between Cookies and cache?
Cookies generally on the server side. while cache is on the client side.
When we go through any website cookies remembers all the pages we are visiting. So that if someone will come next time on their website they don't have to load all those things again. (It will improve the engagement, user experience)
When we visit any website they will load the html css for that page in browser. So that when we will visit that website again we don't have to wait to load those things again. as those things are already present in our browser.
